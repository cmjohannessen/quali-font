## What does this repository contain?

This repository contains both the sample images, data, and code needed to reproduce and inspect the results reported in the article.

## How to use this repository?

The analyses were performed in an [R Markdown Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html), an authoring framework for data science, which runs R code in the RStudio environment.

Because The R Markdown Notebook is self-contained, you don't need to install R or RStudio on your computer to inspect either the code or the analyses. The .nb.html file is self-contained and can simply be viewed in any web browser.

If you're familiar with R and R Studio, the .nb.html-file contains both a rendered copy of the notebook, complete with all images and code chunk outputs, and a copy of the underlying .Rmd-file itself. If you open the .nb.html-file in RStudio, the app will extract and open the .Rmd-file.
